# 06 - Triggering jobs - the `time` resource

"resources are checked every minute, but there's a shorter (10sec) interval for determining when a build should run; time resource is to just ensure a build runs on some rough periodicity; we use it to e.g. continuously run integration/acceptance tests to weed out flakiness" - alex

The net result is that a timer of `2m` will trigger every 2 to 3 minutes.
